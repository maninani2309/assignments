        1 large Onion, chopped (approx. 1/2 cup)
        2 large Tomato, chopped (approx. 3/4 cup)
        1-inch long piece of Cinnamon
        1-2 small cloves of Garlic, chopped
        1/2 inch piece of Ginger, chopped
        1 Green Chilli, chopped
        1 tablespoon grated Beetroot, optional (added to get dark red color)
        1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder
        1 teaspoon Cumin-Coriander Powder, optional
        A pinch of Turmeric Powder, optional
        1/2 cup Milk (or water)
        1/2 cup Water
        1/2 teaspoon Kasuri Methi, (Dried Fenugreek Leaves), optional
        2 tablespoons finely chopped Coriander Leaves, for garnishing
        2 tablespoons Oil
        Salt to taste
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        Heat 1-teaspoon oil in a non-stick kadahi or a heavy base pan. Add cashew nuts.
        Roast them over medium-low flame for around 6-7 minutes until they turn light brown. 
        Stir continuously to roast them evenly and prevent burning. Transfer them to a plate
        In the same kadahi, heat 2-teaspoons oil over medium flame. 
        Add a piece of cinnamon, chopped onion, garlic, ginger, and green chilli.
        Sauté until onion turns translucent. Turn off the flame and let the mixture cool for a while.
        While the mixture is cooling, let’s make the cashew-tomato puree; 
        Add 2 tablespoons (approx. 6-8 whole nuts) roasted cashew nuts in the small jar of a mixer grinder.
        Grind until smooth powder.
        Grind until smooth to make cashew-tomato puree. Transfer it to a small bowl. Scrape the sides with a spatula.
        Remove the lid, mix well and cook uncovered until gravy turns little thick.
        Add kasuri methi and chopped coriander leaves.
        Mix well and turn off the flame. Kaju Curry is now ready for serving.
