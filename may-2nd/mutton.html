        <h3>INGREDIENTS FOR SPICY MUTTON CURRY</h3>
        Mutton / Lamb - 500 grams
        Oil - 4 tblspn
        Onion - 2 large sliced thinly
        Tomatoes - 2 large sliced thinly
        Ginger Garlic Paste - 1 tblspn
        Green Chillies - 3 slit
        Kashmiri Chilli Powder - 2 tblpsn (if using normal chilli powder, use less)
        Coriander Powder - 2 tblspn
        Garam Masala Powder - 2 tsp
        Salt to taste
        Fresh Coconut - Â¾ cup grated
        Water as needed
        Coriander Leaves a handful finely chopped
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        Heat oil in a pressure cooker. Add in onions and cook till golden.
        Once the onion is nice and browned, add in ginger garlic paste and saute for a min or so.
        Add in tomatoes and green chillies. Cook this till tomatoes cook down and turn mushy.
        Add in all the spice powders and salt. Mix well with the masala. The masala should be thick and all most like a paste.
        Now add in mutton and toss well with the masala.
        Keep tossing till the masala coats the mutton pieces and the mutton gets little dark brown in colour.
        Now add in very little water, say around a cup. Cover and pressure cook for 4 whistle, simmer the pan for 15 mins. Turn off the heat and let the steam go all by itself.
        When the mutton is cooking, dry roast the coconut in a dry pan till it is golden brown. Remove it to a blender and make it into a fine puree.
        Once the mutton is cooked, add the coconut paste in it and simmer for another 10 to 15 mins till oil separates on top.
        Add in coriander leaves and turn off the heat.
        Serve with rice or anything you like
